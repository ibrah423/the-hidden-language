  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
    This project examines how the Nazi regime deployed mass media especially posters to shape public thinking,
    normalize exclusionary racial ideology, and construct a political culture in which discrimination appeared
    both necessary and morally justified. Scholars such as Jeffrey Herf argue that Nazi propaganda operated by
    merging emotional appeal with claims of scientific legitimacy, enabling the regime to portray its racial
    worldview as objective truth rather than political doctrine (Herf, <em>The Jewish Enemy</em>). Posters were a
    critical part of this strategy because they reached citizens in everyday spaces and communicated ideology
    through simple, repeated visual cues.
  </p>

  <h2>The Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda</h2>

  <p>
    Under Joseph Goebbels, the propaganda ministry centralized control over nearly all forms of cultural and
    informational life. This included:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Newspapers and journalism</li>
    <li>Film, art, literature, and theater</li>
    <li>Radio broadcasts and large-scale speeches</li>
    <li>Posters, exhibitions, school materials, and pseudo-scientific “racial education” illustrations</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    As Claudia Koonz notes, the aim of this system was not simply censorship but the construction of a moral
    universe in which Nazi values appeared intuitive and socially responsible (<em>The Nazi Conscience</em>).
    Through relentless repetition, the ministry made claims about race, unity, and national duty seem
    self-evident. Posters in particular created what historian David Welch calls a “visual Volksgemeinschaft,” a
    shared sense of belonging that depended on excluding those labeled as biologically or politically dangerous.
  </p>

  <p>
    This curated information environment mattered profoundly. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
    emphasizes that propaganda did not force compliance on its own; rather, it shaped the assumptions through
    which ordinary Germans interpreted national problems and moral choices. By embedding ideology into daily
    routines on street corners, factory walls, schools, train stations the regime cultivated a population primed
    to accept policies that escalated from prejudice to persecution and, ultimately, genocide.
  </p>

  <h2>Purpose of This Project</h2>

  <p>
    The posters analyzed in this project reveal three central dimensions of Nazi messaging: political unity
    built around devotion to Hitler, hereditary fear that framed marginalized groups as biological threats, and
    the false humanitarian language used to justify compulsory sterilization. Richard Evans observes that these
    messages worked because they blended fear with a promise of national renewal, offering Germans a narrative in
    which exclusion and violence appeared necessary for the nation's survival (<em>The Third Reich in Power</em>).
    By studying these images alongside scholarly interpretations, we gain a clearer understanding of how visual
    persuasion conditioned public attitudes and enabled systematic injustice.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ultimately, this project demonstrates that propaganda is not merely historical background but a central tool
    of authoritarian power. Analyzing these posters shows how visual language can normalize radical policies when
    combined with state authority, emotional appeal, and a population encouraged to see ideology as common sense.
